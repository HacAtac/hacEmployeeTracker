<h1>hacEmployeeTracker App!</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
  <p> Dealing with node, npm packages, mysql2, inquirer, console.table I've made a content management system(CMS) that allows users/companies to manage their database of workers and work flow. This has taught me a ton and looking forward to learning more about this! </p>

  <ul>
    <li>First I formated the file structure.</li>
    <li>Then I've downloaded the required NPM packages and required them in files.</li>
    <li>Then i've used mysql2 to create and format tables</li>
    <li>Using the inquirer package to prompt the user in console.</li>
    <li>Then I've created different functions to meet acceptance criteria.</li>
    <li>Utilizing mysql queries inside of functions to format the tables.</li>
    <li>Then I've used console package to console log the formated tables in console.</li>
    <li>This has been a fun and challenging project and i'm looking forward to the next! </li>
  </ul>
